# OpenCode Browser MCP Plugin

An OpenCode plugin that integrates [Browser MCP](https://browsermcp.io) to enable browser automation capabilities within OpenCode. This plugin allows the AI to control a browser, navigate websites, fill forms, click elements, and perform other browser automation tasks.

> **This is a fork of [`michaljach/opencode-browser`](https://github.com/michaljach/opencode-browser), ported to the OpenCode V2 plugin API.**
> Original work and copyright © the `opencode-browser` contributors, MIT licensed.
> Upstream is maintained at version 1.2.3 and does not support OpenCode V2 — see
> [upstream issue #3](https://github.com/michaljach/opencode-browser/issues/3).
> This fork exists because upstream has had no commits since April 2026 and
> because the V2 port required correctness fixes that upstream could not accept
> without a breaking release. Please prefer upstream if your OpenCode version is V1.

## Install

```bash
# from this fork's default branch (no npm publish required)
opencode plugin add github:wypratama/opencode-browser#main
```

## Features

- Full browser automation support through Browser MCP
- **Speed-oriented browser guidance** injected into the model prompt
- **Tool-specific performance hints** for expensive browser actions
- **Fast retry behavior** with no artificial reconnect backoff in the plugin
- Automatic detection of browser-related tasks
- Context preservation for browser state across session compactions
- Seamless integration with OpenCode's existing tools

## Prerequisites

Before using this plugin, you need:

1. **Node.js** installed on your system
2. **OpenCode** installed and configured
3. **Browser MCP extension** installed in your browser (Chrome/Edge)

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Browser MCP Extension

1. Visit [https://browsermcp.io/install](https://browsermcp.io/install)
2. Install the Browser MCP extension for your browser (Chrome or Edge)
3. Follow the extension setup instructions

### Step 2: Configure OpenCode

Fastest path:

```bash
npx @wypratama/opencode-browser-v2 init
```

This creates or updates your OpenCode config with the V2 `plugins` entry and an
`mcp.servers.browsermcp` entry, while preserving any unrelated config you already
have. It writes to `opencode.jsonc` or `opencode.json` — whichever already exists —
and falls back to `opencode.json` if neither does. Existing `plugin` and
`mcp.<name>` keys are migrated to their V2 form; a document that still uses other
V1-only keys (`mode`, `tools`, `agent`, …) is left in V1 shape so OpenCode keeps
reading it.

For a global setup instead of a project-local one:

```bash
npx @wypratama/opencode-browser-v2 init --global
```

The config file can live in one of two locations:

- **Global configuration** (applies to all projects): `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc`
- **Project-specific configuration** (applies to current project only): `./opencode.json` or `./opencode.jsonc` (in your project root)

Learn more about OpenCode configuration at [https://opencode.ai/docs/config](https://opencode.ai/docs/config)

The generated configuration looks like this:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugins": ["@wypratama/opencode-browser-v2"],
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "browsermcp": {
        "type": "local",
        "command": ["npx", "-y", "@browsermcp/mcp@0.1.3"],
        "disabled": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration does two things:
1. **Installs the plugin** - OpenCode loads `@wypratama/opencode-browser-v2`
2. **Configures Browser MCP** - Sets up the MCP server that actually controls the browser

That's it! No manual file copying required. OpenCode handles everything automatically.

The generated command pins the Browser MCP package version to avoid the extra `@latest` resolution step on startup and keep launches reproducible.

If you prefer to preview the generated config without writing it yet:

```bash
npx @wypratama/opencode-browser-v2 init --print
```

#### Alternative: Install Locally (for development/testing)

If you want to modify the plugin or test changes:

**For global installation:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/plugins
cp src/index.ts ~/.config/opencode/plugins/browser-mcp.ts
```

**For project-specific installation:**
```bash
mkdir -p .opencode/plugins
cp src/index.ts .opencode/plugins/browser-mcp.ts
```

The plugin will be automatically loaded on OpenCode startup.

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

The minimal configuration requires only the MCP server setup:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "browsermcp": {
        "type": "local",
        "command": ["npx", "-y", "@browsermcp/mcp@0.1.3"],
        "disabled": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Configuration

For more control, you can deny Browser MCP tools globally and allow them for a single agent:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugins": ["@wypratama/opencode-browser-v2"],
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "browsermcp": {
        "type": "local",
        "command": ["npx", "-y", "@browsermcp/mcp@0.1.3"],
        "disabled": false
      }
    }
  },
  "permissions": [
    { "action": "browsermcp_*", "resource": "*", "effect": "deny" }
  ],
  "agents": {
    "browser-agent": {
      "permissions": [
        { "action": "browsermcp_*", "resource": "*", "effect": "allow" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Behavior

The plugin improves Browser MCP speed by shaping how the model uses browser tools:

- Adds system guidance that prefers direct navigation and fewer browser calls
- Annotates expensive tools like snapshots, screenshots, and waits with performance hints
- Preserves fast-resume guidance during session compaction
- Avoids plugin-side reconnect delays so you can retry immediately when the browser extension is ready

### Environment Variables

If you need to pass environment variables to the Browser MCP server:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "browsermcp": {
        "type": "local",
        "command": ["npx", "-y", "@browsermcp/mcp@0.1.3"],
        "disabled": false,
        "environment": {
          "BROWSER_MCP_DEBUG": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Once installed and configured, you can use browser automation in your OpenCode prompts:

### Basic Browser Navigation

```
Navigate to https://github.com and search for "opencode"
```

### Form Filling

```
Go to the contact form at https://example.com/contact and fill in:
- Name: John Doe
- Email: john@example.com
- Message: Hello from OpenCode!
Then submit the form.
```

### Web Scraping

```

### Complex Automation

```
Go to https://example.com/login, log in with the test credentials,
navigate to the dashboard, and screenshot the main metrics panel
```

### Prompt Tips

For best results when using browser automation:

1. **Be specific** about URLs and actions
2. **Prefer direct URLs** instead of clicking through intermediate pages
3. **Reuse page state** instead of rechecking the same screen repeatedly
4. **Ask for verification only when needed** because snapshots and screenshots are slower than targeted extraction
5. **Specify selectors** when needed (CSS selectors, text content, etc.)

You can also add browser automation guidelines to your `AGENTS.md` file:

```markdown
## Browser Automation

When performing browser automation tasks:
- Always confirm the page has loaded before interacting
- Use descriptive selectors (prefer text content over CSS selectors)
- Take screenshots when verification is needed
- Handle errors gracefully (page not found, element not visible, etc.)
- Close tabs when the task is complete
```

## Plugin Features

### Speed-Oriented Guidance

The plugin biases the model toward faster browser workflows:

- Prefers direct `navigate` calls when the destination URL is known
- Reuses the current tab and page state instead of redoing navigation
- Minimizes `snapshot`, `screenshot`, and `wait` calls unless they are actually needed
- Encourages targeted extraction and direct actions over broad inspection

### Lightweight Connection Recovery

The plugin still detects browser connection issues, but it no longer adds artificial retry sleeps:

- Detects common Browser MCP connection failures from tool output
- Adds immediate retry guidance to the result instead of pausing inside the plugin
- Marks the connection as restored after the next successful browser action

### Automatic Browser Tool Detection

The plugin automatically detects when Browser MCP tools are being used and applies browser-specific guidance.

### Session Context Preservation

During session compaction, the plugin preserves browser automation context, ensuring the AI remembers:
- Browser interactions that occurred
- Current browser state considerations
- Fast-resume guidance so it can avoid repeating navigation and inspection

### Tool Definition Hints

The plugin annotates Browser MCP tool definitions with performance notes, especially for slower tools like snapshots, screenshots, and waits.

## Troubleshooting

### Browser MCP Connection Lost

If you see connection errors:

1. **Check extension status**: Verify the Browser MCP extension is enabled in Chrome
2. **Re-enable extension**: If you disabled it, simply re-enable it and retry the browser action immediately
3. **Check browser is running**: Ensure Chrome/Edge is actually running
4. **Retry after readiness**: The plugin does not add extra backoff delay, so the next attempt can run right away
5. **Restart only if needed**: Restart OpenCode only if the browser stays unavailable after retrying

The plugin will display messages like:
- `[Browser MCP] The browser connection looks unavailable. Re-enable the Browser MCP extension or browser, then retry.`
- `[Browser MCP] Connection restored. Continuing without extra retry delay.`

### Browser MCP Not Working

1. **Check extension is installed**: Open your browser and verify the Browser MCP extension is installed and enabled
2. **Verify MCP server config**: Ensure your `opencode.json` has the correct MCP configuration
3. **Check Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed: `node --version`
4. **Test MCP connection**: Restart OpenCode after adding the MCP configuration

### Plugin Not Loading

1. **Check file location**: Ensure the plugin file is in the correct directory
2. **Check file name**: Plugin files should end in `.ts` or `.js`
3. **Check syntax**: Ensure the TypeScript/JavaScript syntax is valid
4. **Check logs**: Look for plugin initialization messages in OpenCode output

### Tools Not Available

1. **Check MCP server status**: Ensure the Browser MCP server started successfully
2. **Check tool configuration**: Verify tools aren't disabled in your config
3. **Restart OpenCode**: Try restarting OpenCode after configuration changes

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by modifying the plugin or checking OpenCode logs:

```bash
# Check OpenCode logs
opencode --verbose
```
